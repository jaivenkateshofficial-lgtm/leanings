| **Aspect**            | **Process**                                                                         | **Thread**                                                                                                        | **Core**                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | An independent program in execution with its own memory space and system resources. | A smaller unit of execution within a process; shares memory and resources with other threads of the same process. | A physical or logical CPU unit that executes instructions.                       |
| **Memory**            | Has its own dedicated memory (address space).                                       | Shares memory with other threads in the same process.                                                             | Has access to shared system memory; may have private caches.                     |
| **Communication**     | Inter-process communication (IPC) is slower and more complex.                       | Communication between threads is fast and easy since they share memory.                                           | Cores communicate through CPU caches or interconnects; slower than intra-thread. |
| **Creation Overhead** | High — requires more system resources and time.                                     | Low — lightweight and quick to create.                                                                            | Not created by software; determined by hardware (CPU design).                    |
| **Failure Impact**    | Failure of one process does not affect others.                                      | Failure of one thread can crash the entire process.                                                               | Hardware-level — a faulty core may affect performance of the system.             |
| **Parallelism Level** | Enables multitasking (running multiple programs).                                   | Enables multithreading (parallel tasks within the same program).                                                  | Enables true hardware parallelism (multiple instructions run simultaneously).    |
| **Example**           | Running Chrome and Word as separate apps.                                           | Each Chrome tab is a thread in the Chrome process.                                                                | A quad-core CPU has 4 cores that can run 4 threads at once.                      |
| **Managed By**        | Operating System (OS scheduler).                                                    | Operating System and Process (user-level or kernel threads).                                                      | CPU hardware and firmware.                                                       |

 What is a Process?
A process is an independent program in execution.
Each process has:


Its own memory space


Resources (like file handles, system variables)


One or more threads running inside it


Think of a process as a container for program execution.
🧩 Example 1:
When you open Google Chrome, your computer creates a Chrome process.
Inside it, there are multiple subprocesses — for example:


One process for the browser UI


One process per tab


One process for plugins (like video decoding)


Each of these processes runs independently.
If one tab crashes, others can still run — because each is its own process.
🧩 Example 2:
If you open MS Word and Spotify at the same time —
you have two separate processes running.
They don’t share memory or data directly.

⚙️ What is a Thread?
A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.
All threads inside the same process:


Share the same memory and data


Run independently and concurrently


Threads are used to do multiple things at once within the same program.
🧩 Example 1:
In MS Word, you might have:
One thread for typing input
One thread for auto-save
One thread for spell-check


All these threads work together and share the same document data.
🧩 Example 2 (Code Example):
In Python:
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Numbers: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def print_letters():
    for c in 'ABCDE':
        print(f"Letters: {c}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Both threads run in the same process
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

🧩 Output (interleaved):
Numbers: 0
Letters: A
Numbers: 1
Letters: B
...

Here, both functions run concurrently within the same process using threads.
