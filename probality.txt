Additive rule
mutual exclusive event
head or tail it will happen one at the time
a(h or t)=1/2+1/2=1
non mutal execlusive
a(K or heart )=a(k)+a(heart)-a(k amd heart)
It is beacause we need to subract the two event  occur simentaniously

Independent event:
two events does't affect each other
multiplication rule:p(h and  T)=p(h)*P(t)==1/2*/2=1/4

dependent event:
two event dependent on each other
p(k or Q)=p(k)*p(Q/k)
