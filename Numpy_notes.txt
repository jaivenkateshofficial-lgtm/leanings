1.The Numpy is fundamental module to do data nalysis in python
2.we can install numpy by using pip install 
import numpy as np
Feature	Python List	NumPy Array
Performance	Slower for numerical operations	Much faster due to optimized C-based implementation
Memory Usage	Higher	Lower (more compact storage)
Functionality	Basic operations	Rich set of mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions
Element-wise Operations	Manual loops needed	Supports vectorized operations (e.g., arr1 + arr2)
Data Type	Can hold mixed types	Homogeneous (all elements are of the same type)
Broadcasting	Not supported	Supported (e.g., adding a scalar to an array)
Multidimensional Support	Limited (nested lists)	Full support for multi-dimensional arrays (matrices, tensors)
